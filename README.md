# AI Models Repository

This repository contains three main components: fine-tuning Whisper for ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), deployment scripts for models, and fine-tuning an NER (Named Entity Recognition) model using Roberta-XLM. Each component is organized into its own folder, with Jupyter notebooks and scripts for training, fine-tuning, and deployment.
